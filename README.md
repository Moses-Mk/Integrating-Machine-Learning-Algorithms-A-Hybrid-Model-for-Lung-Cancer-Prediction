# Integrating Machine Learning Algorithms: A Hybrid Model for Lung Cancer Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on the development of a hybrid machine learning model to predict lung cancer outcomes. The model integrates multiple machine learning algorithms to improve prediction accuracy, specifically targeting the problem of observational bias in medical datasets. The goal is to improve the reliability of cancer diagnosis predictions and make them actionable for clinical decision-making.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to address key challenges in predictive analytics for lung cancer prediction:
1. **Data Quality**: Handling imperfect and incomplete medical data.
2. **Bias Mitigation**: Reducing the impact of observational bias that can skew predictive outcomes.
3. **Prediction Accuracy**: Achieving reliable, actionable insights for clinical decision-making.

## Methodology
The hybrid model combines multiple machine learning algorithms to strike a balance between interpretability and predictive performance. The key steps in the methodology are outlined below:

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in medical data.
- **Normalization and Scaling**: Ensuring uniform data distributions across features.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracting and selecting relevant features to improve model performance.

### 2. Bias Mitigation
- **Addressing Observational Bias**: The model employs techniques such as rebalancing datasets (e.g., SMOTE) to handle imbalanced class distributions and mitigate bias.
- **Fairness-Aware Algorithms**: Using fairness metrics to ensure equitable predictions across different demographic groups.

### 3. Hybrid Modeling
The hybrid model leverages the power of multiple base algorithms, which are stacked together to improve accuracy. The base models include:
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: `SVC(probability=True)` for classification.
- **XGBoost (XGB)**: `XGBClassifier(use_label_encoder=False, eval_metric='logloss')` for gradient boosting.
- **Random Forest (RF)**: `RandomForestClassifier()` for ensemble learning.
- **LightGBM (LGBM)**: `LGBMClassifier()` for efficient gradient boosting.
- **Logistic Regression (LR)**: `LogisticRegression()` for binary and multiclass classification.

### 4. Model Evaluation
- **Cross-validation**: K-fold cross-validation ensures that the model generalizes well to unseen data.
- **Performance Metrics**: The model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and fairness metrics to assess both prediction quality and bias.

## Results
The hybrid model demonstrated a 15% improvement in prediction accuracy over baseline models. By mitigating bias and enhancing prediction quality, the model is expected to be a valuable tool for supporting clinical decision-making in lung cancer diagnosis.
